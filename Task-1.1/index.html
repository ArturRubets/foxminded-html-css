        <h3>5 Interesting Facts About Rafael Nadal</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Born and raised in Mallorca, he still calls the Spanish island home
            during the offseason. He is one of the few players on the ATP Tour
            still living in their hometown.
          </li>
          <li>
            The most famous left-handed player in tennis right now is actually a
            right-hander in every other facet of his life. At an early age, his
            uncle and longtime coach Toni Nadal noticed that he was hitting
            two-handed forehands off both sides. After some tinkering, it was
            discovered that his strong right-handed backhand could become a
            serious threat later on in life. It's now natural to him to play
            left-handed.
          </li>
          <li>
            With soccer in his blood and tennis being so demanding, Rafael Nadal
            had to make a serious decision when he was 12 years old. There was
            an opportunity to continue focusing on soccer only and hoping for
            the best, or to pursue tennis full-time. He chose the latter, and
            although it's impossible to tell how great he could have been on the
            pitch, most think he made the right decision.
          </li>
          <li>
            Uncle Tony might be well known for his coaching, but another uncle
            named Miguel Angel Nadal is a retired professional soccer player. He
            played for FC Barcelona and RCD Mallorca at the club level and even
            earned 62 caps with the Spanish national team.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spain wanted him to start training in Barcelona to step his game up
            another level as a teenager. His family did not want to pursue this
            option, so they never received the same type of funding as other top
            players in the country. The family strongly felt that a move to
            Barcelona would hurt his education.
